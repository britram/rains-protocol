1.  Introduction

   RAINS, Another Internet Naming Service (RAINS) [RAINS] is a clean-
   slate Internet naming service defined to meet a set of identified
   properties of an ideal Internet naming service.  RAINS was defined in
   the context of the SCION [SCION] architecture.  This document updates
   the RAINS protocol specification with SCION-specific extstions.

2.  SCION Address Objects

   SCION addresses are based on IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, adding an
   Isolation Domain (ISD) and Autonomous System (AS) number.  These two
   additional address components are used to select paths between a
   source and destination of traffic.  RAINS for SCION adds two
   additional object data types to those listed in section 5.12 of
   [RAINS] to support SCION addresses.

          +------+-------------+-------------------------------+
          | Code | Name        | Description                   |
          +------+-------------+-------------------------------+
          |   23 | scion6-addr | SCION IPv6 address of subject |
          |      |             |                               |
          |   22 | scion4-addr | SCION IPv4 address of subject |
          +------+-------------+-------------------------------+

   A scion6-addr (23) object contains a SCION address associated with a
   name.  It is represented as a four element array.  The second element
   is an ISD number as an integer less than or equal to 2^16-1.  The
   third element is an AS number as an integer less than or equal to
   2^48-1.  The fourth element is a byte array of length 16 containing
   an IPv6 address in network byte order.

   A scion4-addr (22) object contains a SCION address associated with a
   name.  It is represented as a four element array.  The second element
   is an ISD number as an integer less than or equal to 2^16-1.  The
   third element is an AS number as an integer less than or equal to
   2^32-1.  The fourth element is a byte array of length 4 containing an
   IPv4 address in network byte order.

2.1.  Address to name mappings for SCION addresses

   Since the IP address part of a SCION address is scoped to the global
   IP address space, reverse lookups for SCION addresses work as reverse
   lookups for IP addresses of the equivalent address family.  The ISD
   and AS number are not used in the address space delegation tree or in
   the query lookup procedure.  Despite this fact, the delegation trees
   for lookup of addresses in the IPv6 and SCION address families is
   kept separate, as an organization may want a name to be bound only to
   their SCION or to their IP space, respectively.

   When the subject-addr (5) key for an address assertion contains
   object type scion6-addr (23), the value is a three element CBOR
   array.  The first element of the array is the address family encoded
   as an object type, here 23.  The second element is the prefix length
   encoded as an integer, 0-128.  The third element is the IPv6 part of
   the address, encoded as a byte array of length 16 in network byte
   order.

   When the subject-addr (5) key for an address assertion contains
   object type scion6-addr (22), the value is a three element CBOR
   array.  The first element of the array is the address family encoded
   as an object type, here 22.  The second element is the prefix length
   encoded as an integer, 0-32.  The third element is the IPv4 part of
   the address, encoded as a byte array of length 4 in network byte
   order.
