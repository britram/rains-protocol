1.  Introduction

   RAINS, Another Internet Naming Service (RAINS)
   [I-D.trammell-rains-protocol] is a clean-slate Internet naming
   service defined to meet a set of identified properties of an ideal
   Internet naming service [I-D.trammell-inip-pins].  RAINS was defined
   in the context of the SCION [SCION] architecture.  This document
   updates the RAINS protocol specification with SCION-specific
   extstions.

2.  SCION Address Objects

   SCION addresses are based on IPv6 addresses, adding an Isolation
   Domain (ISD) and Autonomous System (AS) number.  These two additional
   address components are used to select paths between a source and
   destination of traffic.  RAINS for SCION adds an additional object
   data type to those listed in section 5.12 of
   [I-D.trammell-rains-protocol] to support SCION addresses.

          +------+-------------+-------------------------------+
          | Code | Name        | Description                   |
          +------+-------------+-------------------------------+
          |   23 | scion6-addr | SCION IPv6 address of subject |
          |      |             |                               |
          |   22 | scion4-addr | SCION IPv4 address of subject |
          +------+-------------+-------------------------------+

   A scion6-addr (23) object contains a SCION address associated with a
   name.  It is represented as a four element array.  The second element
   is an ISD number as an integer less than or equal to 2^16-1.  The
   third element is an AS number as an integer less than or equal to
   2^32-1.  The fourth element is a byte array of length 16 containing
   an IPv6 address in network byte order.

   A scion4-addr (22) object contains a SCION address associated with a
   name.  It is represented as a four element array.  The second element

Internet-Draft                    RAINS                        June 2017


   is an ISD number as an integer less than or equal to 2^16-1.  The
   third element is an AS number as an integer less than or equal to
   2^32-1.  The fourth element is a byte array of length 4 containing an
   IPv4 address in network byte order.

   ## Address to name mappings for SCION addresses

   Since the IP address part of a SCION address is scoped to the global
   IP address space, reverse lookups for SCION addresses work exactly as
   reverse lookups for IP addresses of the equivalent address family.
   The ISD and AS number are not used in the address space delegation
   tree or in the query lookup procedure.  Despite this fact, the
   delegation trees for lookup of addresses in the IPv6 and SCION
   address families is kept separate, as an organization may want a name
   to be bound only to their SCION or to their IP space, respectively.

   When the subject-addr (5) key for an address assertion contains
   object type scion6-addr (23), the value is a three element CBOR
   array.  The first element of the array is the address family encoded
   as an object type, here 23.  The second element is the prefix length
   encoded as an integer, 0-128.  The third element is the IPv6 part of
   the address, encoded as a byte array of length 16 in network byte
   order.  A subject address with prefix length 128 is a subject host
   address, and is nameable; otherwise it is a subject network address,
   and is delegatable.

   When the subject-addr (5) key for an address assertion contains
   object type scion6-addr (22), the value is a three element CBOR
   array.  The first element of the array is the address family encoded
   as an object type, here 22.  The second element is the prefix length
   encoded as an integer, 0-32.  The third element is the IPv4 part of
   the address, encoded as a byte array of length 4 in network byte
   order.  A subject address with prefix length 32 is a subject host
   address, and is nameable; otherwise it is a subject network address,
   and is delegatable.

3.  ARPKI certificates in RAINS Certificate objects

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: write me, discuss which types we need here.  At least
   two: a PBC for a domain, or a proof of absence of a PBC.)]
