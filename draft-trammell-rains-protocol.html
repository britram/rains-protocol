  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This document defines an experimental protocol for providing Internet name resolution services, as a replacement for DNS, called RAINS (RAINS, Another Internet Naming Service). It is designed as a prototype to facilitate conversation about the evolution or replacement of the Domain Name System protocol, and was developed as a name resolution system for the SCION (&#8220;Scalability, Control, and Isolation on Next-Generation Networks&#8221;) future Internet architecture <a href="#SCION">[SCION]</a>. It attempts to answer the question: &#8220;how would we design the DNS knowing what we do now,&#8221; on the background of the properties of an ideal naming service described in <a href="#I-D.trammell-inip-pins">[I-D.trammell-inip-pins]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">Its architecture (<a href="#architecture">Section 3</a>) and information model (<a href="#information-model">Section 4</a>) are largely compatible with the existing Domain Name System. However, it does take several radical departures from DNS as presently defined and implemented:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Delegation from a superordinate zone to a subordinate zone is done solely with cryptography: a superordinate defines the key(s) that are valid for signing assertions in the subordinate during a particular time interval.  Assertions about names can therefore safely be served from any infrastructure.</li>
  <li>All time references in RAINS are absolute: instead of a time to live, each assertion&#8217;s temporal validity is defined by the temporal validity of the signature(s) on it.</li>
  <li>All assertions have validity within a specific context. A context determines the rules for chaining signatures to verify validity of an assertion. The global context is a special case of context, which uses chains from the global naming root key. The use of context explicitly separates global usage of the DNS from local usage thereof, and allows other application-specific naming constraints to be bound to names; see <a href="#context-in-assertions">Section 4.1.1</a>.  Queries are valid in one or more contexts, with specific rules for determining which assertions answer which queries; see <a href="#context-in-queries">Section 4.2.1</a>.</li>
  <li>There is an explicit separation between registrant-level names and sub-registrant-level names, and explicit information about registrars and registrants available in the naming system at runtime.</li>
  <li>Sets of valid characters and rules for valid names are defined on a per-zone basis, and can be verified at runtime.</li>
  <li>Reverse lookups are done using a completely separate tree, supporting delegations of any prefix length, in accordance with CIDR <a href="#RFC4632">[RFC4632]</a> and the IPv6 addressing architecture <a href="#RFC4291">[RFC4291]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Instead of using a custom binary framing as DNS, RAINS uses Concise Binary Object Representation <a href="#RFC7049">[RFC7049]</a>, partially in an effort to make implementations easier to verify and less likely to contain potentially dangerous parser bugs <a href="#PARSER-BUGS">[PARSER-BUGS]</a>. Like DNS, CBOR messages can be carried atop any number of substrate protocols; RAINS is presently defined to use TLS over persistent TCP connections (see <a href="#protocol-def">Section 6</a>).</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#terminology" id="terminology">Terminology</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, and MAY, when they appear in all-capitals, are to be interpreted as defined in <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">In addition, the following terms are used in this document as defined:</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">The RAINS architecture is simple, and resembles the architecture of DNS. A RAINS Server is an entity that provides transient and/or permanent storage for assertions about names, and a lookup function that finds assertions for a given query about a name, either by searching local storage or by delegating to another RAINS server. RAINS servers can take on any or all of three roles:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>authority service, acting on behalf of an authority to ensure properly signed assertions are made available to the system (equivalent to an authoritative server in DNS);</li>
  <li>query service, acting on behalf of a client to answer queries with relevant assertions (equivalent to a recursive resolver in DNS), and to validate assertions on the client&#8217;s behalf; and/or</li>
  <li>intermediary service, acting on behalf of neither but providing storage and lookup for assertions with certain properties for query and authority servers (partially replacing, but not really equivalent to, caching resolvers in DNS).</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">RAINS Servers use the RAINS Protocol defined in this document to exchange queries and assertions. RAINS Clients use a subset variant of the RAINS Protocol (called the RAINS Client Protocol) to interact with RAINS Servers providing query services on their behalf.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">Messages in the RAINS Protocol are made up of two kinds of elements: Assertion and Query.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">The information model in this section omits information elements required by the resolution mechanism itself; these are defined in more detail in <a href="#cbor">Section 5</a> and <a href="#protocol-def">Section 6</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1"><a href="#rfc.section.4.1">4.1.</a> <a href="#assertion" id="assertion">Assertion</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">An Assertion is a signed statement about a mapping from a subject name to an object value, and consists of the following elements:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Context: name of the context in which the assertion is valid; see <a href="#context-in-assertions">Section 4.1.1</a> below.</li>
  <li>Subject: name about which the assertion is made.</li>
  <li>Zone: name of the zone in which the assertion is made. The fully qualified name of the subject is made by appending the zone name to the subject name with a domain name separator (&#8216;.&#8217;).</li>
  <li>Type: the type of information about the Subject contained in the assertion. Each Assertion is about a single type of data.</li>
  <li>Object: the data of the indicated type associated with the Subject</li>
  <li>Signatures: one or more signatures generated by the authority for the Assertion. Signatures contain a time interval during which they are considered valid, and may contain a revocation token allowing them to be revoked before the end of the time interval. See <a href="#signatures-in-assertions">Section 4.1.2</a> below.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">The Types supported for each assertion are:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Delegation: the authority associated with the zone identified by the name (roughly equivalent to the DNSSEC DS RRTYPE). The Object contains a public key by which the authority can be identified.</li>
  <li>Redirection: The name(s) of one or more a RAINS servers providing authority service for the authority associated with the zone (roughly equivalent to the DNSSEC NS RRTYPE, but not always consulted directly during resolution).  The Object contains a set of names.</li>
  <li>Address: one or more addresses associated with the name (replaces DNS A and AAAA RTYPEs). The Object contains a set of Addresses. An Address is an {address-family, value} tuple.</li>
  <li>Service-Info: one or more layer 4 ports and hostnames associated with a service name (replaces DNS SRV RRTYPE). The object contains a {hostname, port-number, priority tuple}.</li>
  <li>Name: one or more names associated with the name (roughly equivalent to DNS CNAME). The Object contains a set of names.</li>
  <li>Certificate: a certificate which must appear at a specified location in the certificate chain presented on a connection attempt with the named entity (roughly equivalent to DNS TLSA).</li>
  <li>Zone-Nameset: an expression of the set of names allowed within a zone; e.g.  Unicode scripts or codepages in which names in the zone may be issued. This allows a zone to set policy on names in support of the distinguishability property in <a href="#I-D.trammell-inip-pins">[I-D.trammell-inip-pins]</a> that can be checked by RAINS servers at runtime. An assertion about a Subject within a Zone whose name is not allowed by a valid signed Zone-Nameset expression is taken to be invalid, even if it has a valid signature.</li>
  <li>Zone-Registrar: Information about the organization that caused a Subject name to exist, for registrant-level names.</li>
  <li>Zone-Registrant: Information about the organization responsible for a Subject name, for registrant-level names.</li>
  <li>Infrastructure Key: Information about public keys used for object security within the RAINS infrastructure itself. The Object contains a public key by which a named RAINS server can be identified.</li>
  <li>External Key: Information about public keys used for additional signatures on assertions. The external key is usually discovered outside RAINS, and can be verified by comparison with the key stored in a RAINS assertion. The Object contains an external public key.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.5">For a given {subject, type} tuple, multiple assertions can be valid at a given point in time; the union of the object values of all of these assertions is considered to be the set of valid values at that point in time.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.4.1.1">4.1.1.</a> <a href="#context-in-assertions" id="context-in-assertions">Context in Assertions</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.1">Assertion contexts are used to determine the validity of the signature by the declared authority as follows:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The global context is identified by the special context name `.&#8217;. Assertions in the global context are signed by the authority for the subject name. For example, assertions about the name simplon.inf.ethz.ch in the global context are only valid if signed by the relevant authority inf.ethz.ch.</li>
  <li>A local context is associated with a given authority. The authority-part and the context-part of a local context name are divided by a context marker (&#8216;cx&#8211;&#8217;). The authority-part directly identifies the authority whose key was used to sign the assertion; assertions within a local context are only valid if signed by the identified authority. Authorities have complete control over how the contexts under their namespaces are arranged, and over the names within those contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.3">Assertion context is the mechanism by which RAINS provides explicit inconsistency (see section 5.3.2 of <a href="#I-D.trammell-inip-pins">[I-D.trammell-inip-pins]</a>). Some examples illustrate how context works:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>For the common split-DNS case, an enterprise could place names for machines on its local networks within a separate context. E.g., a workstation could be named simplon.cab.inf.ethz.ch within the context staff-workstations.cx&#8211;.inf.ethz.ch. Assertions about this name would be signed by the authority for inf.ethz.ch. Here, the context serves simply as a marker, without enabling an alternate signature chain: note that the name simplon.cab.inf.ethz.ch can be validly signed by the authority for inf.ethz.ch if no delegation exists for cab.inf.ethz.ch. The context simply marks this assertion as internal. This allows a client making requests of local names to know they are local, and for local resolvers to manage visibility of assertions outside the enterprise: explicit context makes accidental leakage of both queries and assertions easier to detect and avoid.</li>
  <li>Contexts make captive-portal interactions more explicit: a captive portal resolver could respond to a query for a common website (e.g. www.google.ch) with a signed response directed at the captive portal, but within a context identifying the location as well as the ISP (e.g.  sihlquai.zurich.ch.cx&#8211;.starbucks.access.some-isp.net.). This response will be signed by the authority for starbucks.access.some-isp.net. This signature achieves two things: first, the client knows the result for www.google.ch is not globally valid; second, it can present the user with some indication as to the identity of the captive portal it is connected to.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.5">Further examples showing how context can be used in queries as well are given in <a href="#context-in-queries">Section 4.2.1</a> below.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.6">Developing conventions for assertion contexts for different situations will require implementation and deployment experience, and is a subject for future work.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.4.1.2">4.1.2.</a> <a href="#signatures-in-assertions" id="signatures-in-assertions">Signatures in Assertions</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.1">A signature over an assertion contains the following information elements:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Algorithm: identifier of the algorithm used to generate the signature.</li>
  <li>Valid-Since: a timestamp of the start of validity of this signature.</li>
  <li>Valid-Until: a timestamp of the end of validity of this signature.</li>
  <li>Signature: the cryptographic signature itself, whose format is determined by the algorithm used.</li>
  <li>Revocation-Token: an optional revocation token for this signature, which allows a signature to be replaced or removed before the end of its validity.  Revocation tokens are generally based on hash chains, meaning that a signature with a revocation token &#8220;down&#8221; the chain from a given token supercedes it. The format and mechanism used by the revocation token is determined by the alogrithm used. (Note that revocation is a presently unspecified feature in the protocol; see <a href="#hash-chain-rev">Appendix A.1</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.3">The signature protects all the information in an assertion as well as its own valid-since and valid-until values and the revocation token; it does not protect other signatures on the assertion.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.3.p.1">Assertions may also be grouped and signed as a group. A shard is a set of assertions within the same zone and context, protected by one or more signatures over all assertions within the shard. A shard may have an additional property that given a subject and an authenticated shard, it can be shown that either an assertion with a given name and type exists within the shard or does not exist at all.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.3.p.2">A shard has the following information elements:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Context: name of the context in which the assertions in the shard are valid; see <a href="#context-in-assertions">Section 4.1.1</a> above.</li>
  <li>Zone: name of the zone in which the assertions are made.</li>
  <li>Content: a set of assertions sharing the context and zone.</li>
  <li>Signatures: one or more signatures generated by the authority for the shard; see <a href="#signatures-in-assertions">Section 4.1.2</a>.</li>
  <li>Complete-Flag: if true, the shard is lexicographically complete, and subject names that sort such that they would be within the shard if they existed, but are not in the shard, can be assumed not to exist.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.3.p.4">For efficiency&#8217;s sake, information elements within a shard common to all assertions (zone, context, signature) within the shard may be omitted from the assertions themselves.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.3.p.5">A zone is the entire set of shards subject to a given authority within a given context. There are three kinds of zones; treating these zones differently may allow lookup protocol optimizations:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Zones containing only delegation assertions are delegation-only zones.  Delegation-only zones are not relevant as part of an assertion lookup, other than for discovering and verifying authority. Top-level domains are generally delegation-only.</li>
  <li>Zones containing no delegation assertions are final zones. Final zones are not relevant as part of an authority discovery.</li>
  <li>Zones containing at least one delegation assertion and at least one assertion that is not a delegation assertion are mixed zones. No optimizations are available for mixed zones.</li>

<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Context: name of the context in which the assertions in the zone are valid; see <a href="#context-in-assertions">Section 4.1.1</a> above.</li>
  <li>Zone: name of the zone.</li>
  <li>Content: a set of assertions and/or shards sharing the context and zone.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.1">Context is used in queries as it is in assertions (see <a href="#context-in-assertions">Section 4.1.1</a>). Assertion contexts in an answer to a query have to match the context in the query in order to respond to a query. The Context section of a query contains the context of desired assertions; a special &#8220;any&#8221; context (represented by the empty string) indicates that assertions in any context will be accepted.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.2">Query contexts can also be used to provide additional information to RAINS servers about the query. For example, context can provide a method for explicit selection of a CDN server not based on either the client&#8217;s or the resolver&#8217;s address (see <a href="#RFC7871">[RFC7871]</a>). Here, the CDN creates a context for each of its content zones, and an external service selects appropriate contexts for the client based not just on client source address but passive and active measurement of performance. Queries for names at which content resides can then be made within these contexts, with the priority order of the contexts reflecting the goodness of the zone for the client. Here, a context might be zrh.cx&#8211;.cdn-zones.some-cdn.com for names of servers hosting content in a CDN&#8217;s Zurich data center, and a client could represent its desire to find content nearby by making queries in the zrh.cx&#8211;, fra.cx&#8211; (Frankfurt), and ams.cx&#8211; (Amsterdam) contexts within cdn-zones .some-cdn.com. In all cases, the assertions themselves will be signed by the authority for cdn-zones.some-cdn.com, accurately representing that it is the CDN, not the owner of the related name in the global context, that is making the assertion.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.3">As with assertion contexts, developing conventions for query contexts for different situations will require implementation and deployment experience, and is a subject for future work.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.1">An answer consists of a set of assertions, shards, and/or zones which respond to a query. If the query contained a token, it is bound to that query via the token.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.2">The content of an answer depends on whether the answer is positive or negative.  A positive answer contains the information requested in the smallest atomic container that can be found, usually a single assertion. A negative answer contains the information used to verify it; either a shard with the Complete-Flag set, an entire Zone, or a Zone-Nameset assertion showing the name is illegal within the zone.</p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.6"><a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> <a href="#protocol-def" id="protocol-def">RAINS Protocol Definition</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">As noted in <a href="#cbor">Section 5</a>, RAINS is a message-exchange protocol that uses CBOR <a href="#RFC7049">[RFC7049]</a> as its framing. Since CBOR is self-framing &#8211; a CBOR parser can determine when a CBOR object is complete at the point at which it has read its final byte &#8211; RAINS requires no external framing. It can therefore run over any streaming, multistreaming, or message-oriented transport protocol. In order to protect query confidentiality, and support rapid deployment over a ubiquitously implemented transport, RAINS is defined in this document to run over persistent TLS 1.2 connections <a href="#RFC5246">[RFC5246]</a> over TCP <a href="#RFC0793">[RFC0793]</a> with mutual authentication between servers, and authentication of servers by clients. The TLS certificates of RAINS server peers can be verified as specified in the cert-info assertions for those servers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">RAINS servers MUST support this transport; future transports can be negotiated using the capabilities mechanism after bootstrapping using TLS 1.2. As RAINS is an experimental protocol, RAINS servers listen on port 1022 <a href="#RFC4727">[RFC4727]</a> for connections from other RAINS servers and clients. RAINS servers should strive to keep connections open to peer servers, unless it is clear that no future messages will be exchanged with those peers, or in the face of resource limitations at either peer. If a RAINS server needs to send a message to another RAINS server to which it does not have an open connection, it attempts to open a connection with that server.</p>

A server with resource limitations MUST respond to a message rejected due to length restrictions with a notification of type 413 (Message Too Large).

<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.1">Assertions are not valid unless they contain at least one signature that can be verified from the chain of authorities specified by the name and context on the assertion; integrity protection is built into the information model. The infrastructure key object type allows keys to be associated with RAINS servers in addition to zone authorities, which allows a client to delegate integrity verification of assertions to a trusted query service (see <a href="#protocol-client">Section 7</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.2">Since the job of an Internet naming service is to provide publicly-available information mapping names to information needed to connect to the services they name, confidentiality protection for assertions is not a goal of the system. Specifically, the information model and the mechanism for proving non-existence of an assertion is not designed to provide resistance against zone enumeration.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.3">On the other hand, confidentiality protection of query information in crucial.  Linking naming queries to a specific user can be nearly as useful to build a profile of that user for surveillance purposes as full access to the clear text of that client&#8217;s communications <a href="#RFC7624">[RFC7624]</a>. In this revision, RAINS uses TLS to protect communications between servers and between servers and clients, with certificate information for RAINS infrastructure stored in RAINS itself.  Together with hop-by-hop confidentiality protection, query options, proactive caching, default use of non-persistent tokens, and redirection among servers can be used to mix queries and reduce the linkability of query information to specific clients.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">The protocol used by clients to issue queries to and receive responses from an query service is a subset of the full RAINS protocol, with the following differences:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Clients only process assertion, shard, zone, and notification sections; sending a query to a client results in a 400 Malformed Message notification.</li>
  <li>Clients never listen for connections; a client must initiate and maintain a transport session to the query server(s) it uses for name resolution.</li>
  <li>Servers only process query and notification sections when connected to clients; a client sending assertions to a server results in a 400 Malformed Message notification.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">Since signature verification is resource-intensive, clients delegate signature verification to query servers by default. The query server signs the message containing results for a query using its own key (published as an infrakey object associated with the query server&#8217;s name), and a validity time corresponding to the signature it verified with the longest lifetime, stripping other signatures from the reply.

<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.1">An assertion can contain multiple signatures, each with a different lifetime.  Signature lifetimes are equivalent to a time to live in the present DNS: authorities should compute a new signature for each validity period, and make these new signatures available when old ones are expiring.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.2">Since assertion lifetime management is based on a real-time clock expressed in UTC, RAINS servers MUST use a clock synchronization protocol such as NTP <a href="#RFC5905">[RFC5905]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.2"><a href="#rfc.section.8.2">8.2.</a> <a href="#secret-key-management" id="secret-key-management">Secret Key Management</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.1">The secret keys associated with public keys for each RAINS server (via infrakey objects) must be available on that server, whether through a hardware or software security device, so they can sign messages on demand; this is particularly important for query servers. In addition, the secret keys associated with TLS certificates for each server (published via certinfo objects) must be available as well in order to establish TLS sessions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.2">However, storing zone secret keys (associated via delegation objects) on RAINS servers would represent a more serious operational risk. To keep this from being necessary, authority servers have an additional signer interface, from which they will accept and cache any assertion, shard, or zone for which they are authority servers until at least the end of validity of the last signature, provided the signature is verifiable.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.4.p.2">In any case, clients MUST provide a configuration interface to allow a user to specify (by address or name) and/or constrain (by certificate property) a preferred/trusted query server.

<p id="rfc.section.8.5.p.2">RAINS servers can, however, coexist with Domain Name System servers and clients during an indefinite transition period.

<p id="rfc.section.8.5.p.3">While DNSSEC and RAINS keys for equivalent ciphersuites are compatible with each other, there is no equivalent to query option 7 for gateways, since the RAINS signatures are generated over the RAINS bytestream for an assertion, not the DNS bytestream. Therefore, RAINS to DNS gateways must provide verification services for DNS clients. DNS over TLS <a href="#RFC7858">[RFC7858]</a> SHOULD be used between the DNS client and gateway to ensure confidentiality and integrity for queries and answers.</p>

<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Objects of type delegation can be represented as DS RRs, and signatures as RRSIG RRs, but since these keys are verified by the gateway, there is no need to represent this information to the client.</li>
  <li>Objects of type infrakey cannot be represented in DNS, but are irrelevant for DNS translation of RAINS messages, since DNS does not support server signing of responses.</li>
  <li>Objects of type registrar and registrant cannot be represented in DNS; clients can use WHOIS instead. In addition, RRTYPEs could be added for them in the future if RAINS sees significant deployment with DNS as a front-end protocol.</li>
  <li>Objects of type nameset cannot be represented in DNS; the current equivalent are the IDNA parameters maintained by IANA (for the DNS root zone only) at https://www.iana.org/assignments/idna-tables-6.3.0/idna-tables-6.3.0.xhtml.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">The protocol described in this document is intended primarily as a prototype for discussion, though the goal of the document is to specify RAINS completely enough to allow independent, interoperable implementation of clients an servers. The massive inertia behind the deployment of the present domain name system makes full deployment as a replacement for DNS unlikely. Despite this, there are some criteria by which the success of the RAINS experiment may be judged:</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">First, deployment in simulated or closed networks, or in alternate Internet architectures such as SCION, allows implementation experience with the features of RAINS which DNS lacks (signatures as a first-order delegation primitive, support for explicit contexts, explicit tradeoffs in queries, runtime availability of registrar/registrant data, and nameset support), which in turn may inform the specification and deployment of these features on the present DNS.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.3">Second, deployment of RAINS &#8220;islands&#8221; in the present Internet alongside DNS on a per-domain basis would allow for comparison between operational and implementation complexity and efficiency and benefits derived from RAINS&#8217; features, as information for future development of the DNS protocol.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.A.p.1">The following features were suggested during the design of RAINS, but have been left out of the current revision of the specification to allow additional experimentation with them before they are completely specified.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.A.1"><a href="#rfc.appendix.A.1">A.1.</a> <a href="#hash-chain-rev" id="hash-chain-rev">Revocation based on hash chains</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.1">RAINS assertions are scoped in temporal validity by the lifetimes on their signatures. This is operationally equivalent to TTL in the current DNS. An assertion which becomes invalid can simply not be renewed by its authority.  However, very dynamic infrastructures may require impractical numbers of signatures, and could benefit from longer validity times. Allowing an assertion to be revoked would make this possible.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.2">Hash-chain based revocation allows a signature (and the Assertion, Shard, or Zone it protects) to be replaced before it expires. To use hash-chain based revocation, a signing entity generates a hash chain from a known seed using the hash function specified by the signature algorithm in use, and places the Nth value derived therefrom in the hash chain revocation token on a signature.  When used, this token appears as a byte array after the signature data in the signature array.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.3">A revocation can be issued by generating a new section and signing it, revealing the N-1st value from the hash chain in the revocation token. To allow a recipient of a revoked section to verify the revocation, the following restrictions on what can replace what apply:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>An Assertion can only be replaced by another Assertion with the same Subject within the same Context and Zone, containing an Objects array of the same length containing the same types of Objects. To delete Object values, those values can be replaced with Null in the replacing Assertion.</li>
  <li>A Shard can only be replaced by another Shard with an identical shard-range key, within the same Context and Zone. Incomplete Shards cannot be replaced.</li>
  <li>A Zone can only be replaced by another Zone with an identical name within the same Context.</li>

  <li>A method for clients to discover local oracles needs to be specified.</li>
  <li>Consider making negative answers less expensive by allowing a hash of a shard with a negative answer proof to be sent back, and checked with a &#8220;no hashed negative answers&#8221; query option. This would increase complexity somewhat, because it would require the (re-)addition of an Answer section, which could contain such a beast.</li>
